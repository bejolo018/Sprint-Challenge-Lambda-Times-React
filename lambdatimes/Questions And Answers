What are three different ways to style components in React? Explain some of the benefits of each.
The first way is through regular css, which is nice and I personally prefer as it seperates everything nicely and to me makes everything feel more organized. You can also use style in the component itself which is nice if you prefer to have everything in one place, though for me it can be confusing. The other way to style components in react is by using inline stlying which is similar to styling the components with the same benefits but once again I prefer not doing that.
